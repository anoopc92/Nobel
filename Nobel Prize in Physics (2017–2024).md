### 🔎 Significance & Impact

* Their work shaped modern cosmology: helping explain how the universe formed and evolved.
* The exoplanet discovery launched a wave of astronomy searching for planets around other stars — vital for understanding planetary systems, potential for life elsewhere, and the place of Earth in the cosmos.

## **2020 — Black holes: Prediction & Galactic Center supermassive object**

### 🏆 Laureates

* Roger Penrose — for demonstrating that black-hole formation is a robust prediction of general relativity.
* Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez — for discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy. ([NobelPrize.org][1])

### ⚛️ Discoveries / Contributions

* Penrose’s theoretical work showed that under general relativity, a collapsing massive star will inevitably form a black hole — establishing black hole formation as a reliable prediction. ([NobelPrize.org][2])
* Genzel & Ghez provided observational evidence that a supermassive compact object resides at the centre of the Milky Way — consistent with a supermassive black hole. ([NobelPrize.org][1])

### 🪐 Significance & Impact

* Provided deep insight into the nature of black holes, some of the most extreme objects in the universe.
* Bridged theory and observation: confirmed that black holes aren’t just theoretical constructs but real astrophysical objects.
* Opened paths for further study — e.g. black hole physics, galaxy formation, gravitational-wave sources, and extreme gravity tests.

## **2021 — Complex Systems: Climate Models & Disordered Systems**

### 🏆 Laureates

* Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann — for physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and predicting global warming.
* Giorgio Parisi — for discovering the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales. ([NobelPrize.org][3])

### 🧮 Discoveries / Contributions

* Manabe & Hasselmann: developed climate models that help predict and quantify climate change trends — bridging physics and climate science. ([Live Science][4])
* Parisi: theoretical discoveries about how disorder and random fluctuations influence physical systems across scales (from atoms to large complex systems). ([NobelPrize.org][3])

### 🌍 Significance & Impact

* Their work laid a foundational **scientific basis for understanding climate change**, making climate predictions more reliable. — highly relevant for policy, environment, global future.
* Parisi’s results apply broadly — from condensed-matter physics to complex systems in biology, economics, social systems — wherever disorder and fluctuations matter.
* Demonstrates how physics isn’t just about fundamental particles — it's a tool to understand real-world complex systems.

# 🧩 Cross-Year Themes & Insights (2017–2024)

* **From fundamental to applied**: Some awards (2017, 2020, 2022) confirm deep theories about the universe or quantum world; others (2018, 2023, 2024) give tools with broad applications (medicine, materials, AI).
* **Expanding scope of physics**: It’s not only about stars, black holes or lasers — physics increasingly intersects with **climate science**, **complex systems**, **information science**, **AI**.
* **Bridging theory and experiment**: Many laureates either confirmed long-standing theories (like black holes or entanglement) or developed totally new techniques to observe phenomena (gravitational waves, attosecond pulses).
* **Societal relevance**: Climate modelling (2021), quantum information (2022), AI foundations (2024), biophysics tools (2018) — all show how physics research can influence global issues, technology, and everyday life.
* **Interdisciplinary future**: The trajectory suggests future physics Nobel Laureates may come from even more cross-disciplinary frontiers — e.g. complex systems, quantum tech, AI, climate, materials, etc.

If you like — I can also **extend** this case study to cover the **last 20 years** (2005–2024), not just 2017 onward — that gives a broader picture of how physics research & Nobel priorities have evolved.
Would you like me to build that extended version for you now?
